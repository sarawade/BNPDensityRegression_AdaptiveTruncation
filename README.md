# BNPDensityRegression_AdaptiveTruncation
Adaptive truncation algorithm for posterior inference of a Bayesian nonparametric multivariate density regression model

This matlab code provides posterior inference for the multivariate density regression model with normalised weights. The main code in AT_NWR.m is an adaptive truncation algorithm, which produces weighted particles, representing draws from the posterior. The file SimulatedStudyRun.m provides a simple example of how to run the code on simulated data.
